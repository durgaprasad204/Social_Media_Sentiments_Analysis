In my Social Media Sentiment Analysis project, I utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze user sentiments expressed on various platforms. The project involved data collection using APIs (such as the Twitter API) and web scraping, followed by extensive data preprocessing and feature engineering using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. I implemented various machine learning models for text classification, evaluating their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Additionally, I leveraged data visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to present insightful visualizations, illustrating trends and patterns in the sentiment data. The project showcases my proficiency in deep learning techniques, including the use of word embeddings for improved text representation, as well as my ability to create comprehensive dashboards for real-time sentiment tracking. Overall, this project demonstrates my skills in data analysis, big data technologies, and my commitment to continuous learning in the field of data science.
